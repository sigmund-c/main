== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/cardibuddy/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/cardibuddy/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

{empty} +

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DeckListPanel`, `FlashcardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CardiBuddyParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a deck).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete deck 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete deck 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

// tag::ash-logictoui[]
== LogicToUiManager
This class serves as a bridge between relevant `Command` classes and the `Ui`, for use cases that do not update the `ObservableList`. It calls specific methods in the `MainWindow` class to modify the display to the user according to the `Command` executed.

The `LogicToUiManager` object is created upon startup in the MainApp class, and there can exist only one instance of it throughout the use of CardiBuddy.

*Commands that make use of `LogicToUiManager`:*

. `OpenCommand`
. `AddCommand`
. `DeleteDeckCommand`
. `DeleteCardCommand`
. `TestCommand`
. `AnswerCommand`
. `NextCommand`
. `QuitCommand`
. `SkipCommand`
. `SearchCardCommand`
. `StatisticsCommand`
. `ListCommand`

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `LogicToUiManager` can be used to modify the `MainWindow`, when CardiBuddy needs to display the flashcard question to the user during a `Test Session`. More details on `Test Session` in the section: <<test-session>>.

This diagram is also an extension of the <<test-sequence-diagram, sequence diagram>> found in that section.

// end::ash-logictoui[]


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/cardibuddy/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the CardiBuddy data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Deck>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/cardibuddy/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the CardiBuddy data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `cardibuddy.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Design

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCardiBuddy`.
It extends `CardiBuddy` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `cardiBuddyStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCardiBuddy#commit()` -- Saves the current CardiBuddy state in its history.
* `VersionedCardiBuddy#undo()` -- Restores the previous CardiBuddy state from its history.
* `VersionedCardiBuddy#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone CardiBuddy state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCardiBuddy()`, `Model#undoCardiBuddy()` and `Model#redoCardiBuddy()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCardiBuddy` will be initialized with the initial CardiBuddy state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single CardiBuddy state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th deck in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCardiBuddy()`, causing the modified state of CardiBuddy, after the `delete 5` command executes, to be saved in the `cardiBuddyStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted CardiBuddy state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add d/cs2103T ...` to add a new deck. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCardiBuddy()`, causing another modified CardiBuddy state to be saved into the `cardiBuddyStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCardiBuddy()`, so the CardiBuddy state will not be saved into the `cardiBuddyStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the deck was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCardiBuddy()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous CardiBuddy state, and restores the CardiBuddy to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous CardiBuddy states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCardiBuddy()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoCardiBuddy()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the CardiBuddy to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `cardiBuddyStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest CardiBuddy state, then there are no undone CardiBuddy states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCardiBuddy()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the CardiBuddy, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCardiBuddy()`, `Model#undoCardiBuddy()` or `Model#redoCardiBuddy()`. Thus, the `cardiBuddyStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCardiBuddy()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `CardiBuddyStateList`, all CardiBuddy states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add d/cs2103T ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire CardiBuddy.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the deck being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of CardiBuddy states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedCardiBuddy`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::jingying[]
=== Flashcards
==== Design
Users are able to add two different types of cards -- cards with images and cards without. These cards have three types of answers -- True/False, MCQ and short answers.

The following is a Use Case Diagram for this feature:

image::CardsAnswersUseCase.png[]

===== Model Component
The following classes can be found inside _cardibuddy/model/flashcard_.

The add feature revolves around 2 abstract classes: `Card` and `Answer`.

The `Card` class is extended by two card classes: `Flashcard` and `Imagecard`.

The `Answer` class is extended by three answer classes: `TfAnswer`, `McqAnswer` and `ShortAnswer`.

===== Logic Component
To add a card, a deck must first be opened. This can be checked from accessing the `LogicToUiManager` which stores the currently opened deck.
Subsequently, The `Parser` classes will separate the relevant arguments from the user input and execute commands from the `Command` classes.
These `Parser` and Command` classes are part of the *Logic* component of CardiBuddy, and can be found within the _cardibuddy/logic_ package.

These commands allow the user to add the different types of flashcards and answers into a deck:

* The user will first open a deck.
* _Adding a Flashcard:_ The user will enter `add` followed by `q/` with their question and `a/` with their answer.
* _Adding an Imagecard:_ The user will enter `add` followed by `p/` with the filepath to the image, `q/` with their
question and `a/` with their answer.
* _Adding a TfAnswer_: The user will enter either `T` or `F` for their answer after the `a/` prefix.
Only capital, single-lettered answers are accepted and a `WrongTfException` will be thrown if the user enters `t`, `f`, `True` or `False`.
* _Adding an MCQAnswer_: The user will enter `A)CHOICE_A B)CHOICE_B C)CHOICE_C`, with the correct choice positioned first, for their answer after the `a/` prefix.
In other words, if `C)CHOICE_C B)CHOICE_B A)CHOICE_A` is entered by the user, `C` will be taken as the correct answer.
A `WrongMcqAnswerException` will be thrown if the user input does not have all three options in capital letters with parentheses.

==== Types of Cards

===== Flashcard
To add a `Flashcard` in an opened deck, the user will enter `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`.
A sample command would be `add q/Is defensive code desirable at all times? a/F`. +
 +
The following sequence diagram shows how a `Flashcard` is created from the above command and displayed immediately in the flashcard panel to the user:

image::AddFlashcardDiagram.png[]

===== Imagecard
To add an `Imagecard` in an opened deck, the user will enter `add p/file:IMAGE_FILEPATH q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`.
A sample command would be `add p/file:/Users/Jing/ArchitectureDiagram.png q/What kind of diagram is this?
a/B)Architecture C)Sequence A)Object`. +
 +
When an `ImagecardCard` is displayed in the `FlashcardPanel`, the image will be
 retrieved via the stored `IMAGE_FILEPATH` from the user's computer.
If the file path is invalid, the middle part of the card will be blank and an image will not be shown.
 More information regarding the implementation of the `Ui` can be found inside _cardibuddy/ui/ImagecardCard_. +
 +
The following sequence diagram shows how an `Imagecard` is created from the above command and displayed immediately in the flashcard panel to the user:

image::AddImagecardDiagram.png[]

It is largely similar to the sequence diagram for the creation of a `Flashcard` but with an extra `IMAGE_FILEPATH` argument.

==== Types of Answers
When adding cards, the `ParserUtil` will parse the different answer inputs to create one of the three different types of answers.

The following activity diagram shows how the `ParserUtil` chooses which type of answer object to create:

image::AnswerActivityDiagram.png[]

===== TfAnswer
For a `TfAnswer` to be associated with a `Card`, the user will have to enter either `T` or `F` after the answer prefix `a/`.
A sample command was mentioned in the example for `Flashcard` above: `add q/Is defensive code desirable at all times? a/F`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `ParserUtil` class creates a `TfAnswer` answer based on the given sample command:

image::ParserUtilTfDiagram.png[]

===== McqAnswer
For an `McqAnswer` to be associated with a `Card`, the user will have to enter
`A)CHOICE_A B)CHOICE_B C)CHOICE_C`, with the correct choice positioned first, for their answer after the answer prefix `a/`.
A sample command was mentioned in the example for `Imagecard` above: `add p/file:/Users/Jing/ArchitectureDiagram.png q/What kind of diagram is this?
a/B)Architecture C)Sequence A)Object`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `ParserUtil` class creates an `McqAnswer` answer based on the given sample command:

image::ParserUtilMcqDiagram.png[]

===== ShortAnswer
For a `ShortAnswer` to be associated with a `Card`, the user will have to enter an answer that does not fulfil the
requirements of both `TfAnswer` and `McqAnswer` after the answer prefix `a/`.
A sample command would be `add q/How does one go about solving recursion problems? a/Wishful thinking`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `ParserUtil` class creates a `ShortAnswer` answer based on the given sample command:

image::ParserUtilShortAnsDiagram.png[]
// end::jingying[]

==== Design Considerations
// tag::design[]
===== Aspect: How to implement the different card and answer types

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using an abstract class to contain general functionalities.
** Pros: Can define method bodies general methods. Easier to make changes such as creating new methods which can be defined directly in the abstract class.
** Cons: Child `Card` and `Answer` classes cannot extend multiple abstract classes.
* **Alternative 2:** Using an interface to contain general functionalities.
** Pros: Supports multiple inheritances.
** Cons: Cannot define method bodies in the interface.

Due to the similarities in method bodies of the different answers and cards classes, a `Card` and `Answer` abstract class was used instead of an interface. +

// end::design[]
{empty} +

// tag::ash-test-feature[]
=== Test feature
==== Design
A flashcard application is not complete without the ability to test oneself.

===== Model Component
The following classes can be found inside _cardibuddy/model/testsession_.

The test feature revolves around 2 classes: `TestSession` and `TestResult`.

`TestSession` stores the tested deck, retrieves the questions to be tested, acts according to the user's commands and manages the <<test-queue, test queue>>.

`TestResult` stores the `Result` (explained below) of each _individual_ test on a flashcard. That is, whether the flashcard was answered wrongly, correctly, or was skipped. `Result` is an enums class to store these 3 outcomes.

Another enums class used is `AnswerType` which contains 3 answering options to display to the user - True/False, MCQ or Short Answer.

To ensure good design practice, `Test Session` is not exposed to the other classes, but is instead called using the `ModelManager`.

The following figure is a more focused class diagram for the _cardibuddy/model/testsession_ package, and displays important methods and fields used.

Click <<Design-Model, here>> to view the full class diagram for the `Model` component, to see all the classes within `Model` interact.

.Class diagram for the test session package.
image::TestFocusClassDiagram.png[]


===== Logic Component
The test feature makes use of a suite of `Command` classes exclusive to a `TestSession`. These `Command` classes are part of the *Logic* component of CardiBuddy, and can be found within the _cardibuddy/logic/testsession_ package.

These commands allow the user to perform the following during a test session:

* The user will enter `test INDEX` to start the test session for the deck at the `INDEX`.
* The user will enter `ans` followed by their answer to the question.
* The user can use the `next` command to view the next question.
* The user can choose to `skip` questions
* The user can choose to `quit` the session halfway
* The user can choose to `force` correct their answer if they wish to manually mark their answer as correct.

The above commands can only be triggered when certain conditions are met. The following table provides a summary of all the `Command` classes related to the test feature, as well as the conditions for their execution and exceptions thrown when these conditions are not met.

.Summary of Test Feature Commands
[width="59%",cols="5%,<5%,<25%,<60%,<5%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Command Class|Corresponding user input|Description|Conditions|Exceptions Thrown

|ForceCommand|`force`|Forces CardiBuddy to mark the user's submitted answer as correct.|The user must have submitted an incorrect answer.|UnansweredQuestionException, AlreadyCorrectException
|=======================================================================

==== Using the test feature
===== Starting a Test Session
Users can start a TestSession with a chosen `Deck`:

* The `index` of the deck will be provided by the user and parsed by Cardi Buddy. A `TestSession` object containing the indicated `Deck` is created.
* The `TestSession` object creates a HashMap named `testResults` that contains `<Flashcard, TestResult>` for easy access to the testing history.

The following is a UML Sequence Diagram of how a `TestSession` object is created when the `test INDEX` command is called:

[[test-sequence-diagram]]


.A sequence diagram illustrating the logic flow when a TestSession is created. The first question in the provided deck will immediately be displayed.
image::TestSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Other commands included in the Test Feature
Aside from `TestCommand` which is called to create the `TestSession`, there are specific commands that can be used only when a TestSession is running. These commands have certain *conditions* that must be met before they can be executed. Otherwise, they will throw a `CommandException`.

For example, other application-wide commands, such as `add deck` and `delete card` will not be allowed to be executed during the TestSession.



The following activity diagrams describe the logic flow.

Note the following terminology used in the activity diagrams:

* `tr` stands for a `TestResult` object
* `testResults` stands for a `HashMap<Flashcard, TestResult>` object stored in the `TestSession` object
* `testQueue` is a `LinkedList<Flashcard>` that stores the queue of flashcards to be tested.

.Overall activity diagram for the different use cases, extension cases omitted.
image::TestSessionActivityDiagram.png[]




For more descriptive use case scenarios from a user's perspective, please take a look at <<Use Cases>>.


==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Data structure for the test queue
* *Alternative 1*
+
* Use an ArrayList to store the flashcards in the test queue.
+
** Pros:
+
*** Makes use of the current data structure used to store flashcards in a list.
+
*** Easy retrieval of flashcards at indices.
+
*** Easy iteration of the flashcard list.
** Cons:
+
** Possible difficulties in designing how flashcards should be retested.
+
** It is possible that we create a large ArrayList, and split it such that the first half is used for flashcards that have not been tested, and the second half be used for flashcards that are going to be retested.
+
** However, this approach is unnecessarily complicated, and uses excessive memory space.
+
** In addition, it is still difficult to check if flashcards have been tested before, which is part of our feature which counts the number of times a flashcard has been attempted.

* *Alternative 2 (current choice)*
+
* Use a LinkedList to store the flashcards in the test queue.
** Pros:
+
*** Easy insertion and removal of flashcards from the front and back of the queue, which is the main driver behind a test session.
** Cons:
+
*** Difficult to retrieve flashcards at indices, and check if a flashcard has been visited before
+
*** In addition, other features of CardiBuddy require the easy retrieval of flashcards such as the get(index) method offered by ArrayList.
** Why we went with this:
+
*** Logically, a test session will not be used as often as the other commands that entail retrieval of elements at a specific index, such as the `edit` command.
+
*** There may be some overhead in converting the ArrayList used to a LinkedList, but our tests have showed minimal lag in starting a test session.
+
** Workarounds:
+
*** To still retain the ability to check if a flashcard has been visited before, we use a separate HashMap data structure that makes use of flashcards that have been visited before as keys.
+
** A HashMap will also allow us to link a flashcard to a specific TestResult, and modify it as needed (such as when a user calls force correct on the flashcard).

{empty} +

===== Aspect: How to store the results of each individual test on a flashcard
* *Alternative 1*
+
* Use a `Result` enums to indicate if the question was correct, wrong or skipped
+
** Pros:
+
*** An enums class improves code readability, and ensures that there are only 3 possible results linked to each flashcard.
+
** Cons:
+
*** Too simplistic and does not give room for further enhancements as described below.

* *Alternative 2 (current choice)*
+
* Use a custom `TestResult` class that stores the user answer, as well as the model flashcard answer
+
** Pros:
+
*** Provides room for further customisation, such as recording the number of attempts on the flashcard, which alternative 1 was unable to achieve.
+
*** More Object-Oriented Design, and keeps `TestSession` from getting too cluttered.
+
** Cons:
+
*** Higher chance for error as more code and methods needed to be written.

{empty} +

==== Aspect: When to replace the `current` variable holding the latest flashcard that was tested

* *Alternative 1*
+
* Move on to the next question, hence replacing `current`, as soon as the user submits their answer.
** Pros:
+
*** Simple and easy to implement
+
** Cons:
+
*** This would have been fine in the initial stages, but would not work after further enhancements (`skip`, `force`) were added.
+
*** The 2 mentioned enhancements require modifying of the `testResults` HashMap, and hence require the flashcard they are being used on as a key to retrieve and modify the TestResult.

* *Alternative 2 (current choice)*
+
* Only replace `current` with the next flashcard when `next` or `skip` is used.
+
** Pros:
+
*** These 2 commands are the ones that trigger the displaying of the next question in the queue to the user.
+
*** This ensures that should there be a need to retrieve the current flashcard, such as in modifying the `testResults` HashMap as well as checking the flashcard's `CardType` (image or normal) and getting its `AnswerType`.
+
** Cons:
+
*** This complicates the code, and may possibly be difficult to understand for another developer.
+
** Workarounds:
+
*** Do our best to document the test feature in this Developer's Guide, and supplement it with activity diagrams and other explanations to help the reader better understand the workings of this feature.
// end::ash-test-feature[]
{empty} +

=== Statistics
==== Design
The user's activities will be logged and stored in `Statistics`. It is entirely a data storage class, recording data wherever necessary.

Currently, the actions that update the `Statistics` are:

* Adding and removing a deck
* Adding and removing a card
* Finishing a `TestSession` - this updates a number of items, which are:
** `TestSessions` finished
** Total cards answered
** Average correct percentage
** Average tries to get correct

There's 2 different locations where a `Statistics` instance is stored:

* `CardiBuddy`: The Model of the program. Tracks user statistics across the whole program.
* `Deck` : Each `Deck` also has a `Statistics` instance. This is to help identify which `Deck`s are used more often, are more difficult, etc.

Each time the user does something that can be tracked, it updates both the universal `Statistics` and the `Statistics` of the `Deck` that he or she is using. The call to update both statistics is done simultaneously in the `CardiBuddy` model for adding/removing decks/cards, or in `ModelManager` for finishing a `TestSession`.

{empty} +

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

* Easy for computing students to learn and remember

3. Retests cards
* More tests for flashcards that the student got wrong

4. Flexible answering
* Students can paraphrase their answers, and manually evaluate if their answers are correct
* No need for word-for-word answers
* Accommodates different module types and scenarios eg. having to describe a situation, or a diagram
* Paraphrasing is also a much more effective way to learn, compared to rote memorisation

[appendix]
== Glossary

[[mainstream-os]] Mainstream OS::
Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X


[[flashcard]] Flashcard::
A card created by the user to test themselves. Contains a question and an answer.

Example

 Question: `Give the code to create a new ArrayList containing Integers`
 Answer: `ArrayList<Integer> lst = new ArrayList<>();`

[[deck]] Deck::
A group containing flashcards belonging to the same category, both of which are created and defined by the user.

Example

 A deck named "CS2103T" contains the flashcards testing CS2103T content.

[[tag]] Tag::
A single word that can be attached to a deck. Typically describes the category the deck belongs to, and is used to filter and organise the user's flashcards.

Example

 A tag called "computing" can be assigned to decks named "CS2103T", "CS2101" and "CS3223". When the user filters their deck by the tag "computing", these 3 decks will be shown. (These 3 modules are read in the School of Computing)

[[test-session]] Test Session::
A session started by the user when the user wishes to test themselves on the contents of a deck. Each flashcard in the deck specified by the user is shown sequentially, and can only proceed when the user enters the answer to the question.


[[test-queue]] Test Queue::
A temporary queue created when a Test Session is started. It stores the flashcards that either have not been tested yet, or have been tested but the user got wrong.

== Product Survey

*Quizlet*

Author: Andrew Sutherland

Pros:

* User can create an account
* Clean user interface
* Ability to search for decks created by other users
* Ability to turn flashcard questions into 3 different kinds of questions: True and False, MCQ and short answer
* 3 different ways to test self: Test, Write and Swipe/Flip
* Ability to play a timed matching game to match questions to their answers
* "Don't know" option if the user does not know the answer to the question.

Cons:

* Confusing options for tests: "write", "test" and "swipe/flip"
** Both "write" and "test" tests the user on flashcard content.
** However, "write" allows the user to force correct on the flashcard while "test" only allows the user to skip the question.
** Hence answers need to be written word for word to be marked as correct when using "test"
** The "swipe/flip" test option is not displayed together with the write and test options, and user has to navigate around before stumbling onto it.
*** These similar options may overwhelm the user with too much choice.
*** Naming of the options are also not clear (eg. "write")

* Scrolling view of flashcards at the end of test sessions, instead of a list view of the cards and their outcomes.
* Difficult to add a new flashcard to an existing deck
** Had to explore many options before finding a "..." button at the top right hand corner, which displayed a dropdown list of options for the set. User has to select edit set, before being able to
* More confusing naming
** Statistics (not seen, familiar, mastered for flashcards are nested under the option "Learn"
