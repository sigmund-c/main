_CardiB_ was developed by the https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-T10-2/main[AY1920S2-CS2103-T10-2] team based on _AddressBook - Level 3._ +

Cardi Buddy (CardiB) is for students who *prefer to use a desktop app to store their revision materials as flashcards*. More importantly, CardiB is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CardiB can help you to *store revision materials quickly*. The self-testing features will definitely help you to *ace your examinations* as opposed to traditional ways of revision by re-reading lecture notes. +

We are a team based in the http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].
